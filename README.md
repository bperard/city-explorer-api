# City Explorer API

**Author**: Brandon Perard
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
In this lab assignment, you will begin building your own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that your server will manage.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
